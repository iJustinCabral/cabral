# Welcome to My Personal Blog

After years of procrastination, I decided to build my own blog system. This gives me complete control over my content and the ability to customize the experience exactly how I want it.

## Why Build My Own?

- **Ownership**: My content, my rules
- **Customization**: Perfect integration with my personal website  
- **Learning**: Great opportunity to build something from scratch

## Technical Details

This blog is powered by:
- Express.js backend with file-based storage
- React frontend with my existing design
- Markdown support for rich content

Let's have some fun? More posts coming soon!
